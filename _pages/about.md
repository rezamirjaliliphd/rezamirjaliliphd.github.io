I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Houston working in <a href='https://www.ie.uh.edu/research/centers-labs/socl'> System Optimization and Computing Laboratroy (SOCL) </a>, specializing in operations research, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning for logistics systems. My research focuses on developing exact and intelligent algorithms to solve large-scale network design and routing problems with a particular emphasis on drone-assisted delivery systems.
I have experience designing branch-and-price-and-cut frameworks, integrating reinforcement learning with optimization, and accelerating shortest path subroutines under complex constraints. My work spans both theoretical modeling and computational implementations in Rust, C, C++, Python, and Cython.

### Research Interests

I work at the intersection of **optimization**, **algorithm design**, and **AI**, targeting scalable decision-making systems for logistics and transportation.
My work focuses on combinatorial optimization, exact algorithms, and intelligent heuristics, with applications in both deterministic and stochastic logistics and transportation systems.
I develop scalable, intelligent exact methods—such as branch-and-price-and-cut—employing DRL-assisted column and cut generation to solve complex routing and scheduling problems.
My current research explores the integration of deep learning and mathematical optimization for multi-echelon vehicle routing and drone-assisted delivery networks.

- **Vehicle Routing & Drone Coordination** in hybrid delivery networks
- **Branch-and-Price-and-Cut (BPC)** for path-based routing problems
- **Shortest Path with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC)** using bidirectional labeling through DRL-based label propagation
- **Cutting Plane Generation**, e.g., Chvátal-Gomory and cycle-elimination cuts and hybrid cutting plane
- **Reinforcement Learning for Optimization** (pricing, branching, cuts)
- **AI-Guided Subproblem Prioritization** in column generation
